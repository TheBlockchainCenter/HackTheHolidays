Genswap is an automated market making decentralized exchange built on GeneriX custom Substrate blockchain.

Genswap introduces a new blockchain scaling methodology termed 'generic liquidity' by allowing users to pay blockchain transaction fees using listed custom tokens.

Implements off-chain workers unsigned transactions with signed payloads.

Users intialize transactions without the need to have gas forehand, however the send a signed payload allowing Genswap to swap 'x' amount of a listed token 'y' to the native Substrate blockchain currency (GEX). The signed payload may include arbitrary blockchain computation logic including: *Sending tokens *Deploying smart contracts *Calling on-chain smart contracts

Swapped transaction fees are sent to the GeneriX Treasury.

GeneriX utilizes a Hybrid PoW-PoS chain consensus and with no tokens premined - follows Kulupu example
